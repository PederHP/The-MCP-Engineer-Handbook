Development Notes
==================

This server demonstrates dynamic resource loading from a filesystem.

Key features:
- Files are discovered dynamically (no hardcoded list)
- Binary files (images) are served as base64-encoded blobs
- Text files are served as plain text
- MIME types are inferred from file extensions

Try adding more files to this folder and they'll appear automatically!
